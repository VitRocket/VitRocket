👋 Hi, I’m @VitRocket

I’m a software engineer focused on building reliable, well-structured systems and real-world products.

👀 I’m interested in
- Backend development (Java, Spring)
- Software architecture (hexagonal, modular design)
- Product-oriented development
- Clean code, maintainability, long-term solutions

🌱 I’m currently learning
- Advanced system design and architecture patterns
- Android & Kotlin (product-side perspective)
- Improving my English and German for professional communication

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
- Small to mid-size products with real users
- Backend-heavy or architecture-focused projects
- Tools and apps that solve practical problems
